# 2270SortingAlgorithms

 Authors: Soham Shah, Dmytro Rzyhkov, Girish Ramkumar, Arlin Tawzer

The purpose of this program is to write code to compare the algorithmic complexity of various sorting algorithms over a randomized data set. We will do this by first randomizing integers from 1 through 1000 and placing them into an array. Then we will clone the array several times. Each of the cloned arrays will have a seperate sorting algorithm applied to it and we will then output which algorithm took the least algorithmic cost.
